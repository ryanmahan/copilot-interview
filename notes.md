## Oddities

Copilot suggested links that broke the leetcode site, ex. roman to integer suggested a solution link to median of two sorted arrays, which was the previous attempted problem

Copilot is starting to write comments like me

Copilot is suggesting memory and runtime complexities that are 50/50 right/wrong

Copilot suggested "find the max water that can be trapped in the array" off of "given an array of building heights"
